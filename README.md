<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Q: I can't see my skills in the search window.</strong></p>
<p>A: You will need to add your profession with the '<strong>/gt addprofession</strong>' command.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I can't see my guild member's skills.</strong></p>
<p>A: Currently if your guild members do not have the addon or have not added their professions their skills will not appear in the search window.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I can't see skill X.</strong></p>
<p>A: The addon does not have a complete list of trade skills. It only tracks the skills it has been told about. Additionally the number of results is currently capped at 200 alphabetically sorted. Try searching for the skill in the text search box.</p>
